Xcode7 (in beta)

Installing
==========

On the server side, you'll need to do some basic setup-

Navigate to the node directory and run the following command
    npm install

Once that is done you can run the code.

On the iOS side, open the xcodeproject in Xcode 7. Navigate to the General settings for the project, and under Identity, click on fix issue. Xcode would require you to sign in with your developer ID. Once the issue is fixed, you can deploy the code to an iPhone by changing the target device on the top toolbar.(Make sure your iphone is connected to the computer).

How to run

To run the server simply navigate to the node folder and run the following command-

    npm start

To run the client similarly, navigate to the node folder and run the following command-
    npm run run-app
